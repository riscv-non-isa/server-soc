== Introduction

The RISC-V Server SoC Test Specification defines a set of tests to verify if the
requirements specified in RISC-V Server SoC specification are implemented. The
tests specified in this specification are not intended to exhaustively verify
the implementation. In most cases the tests only check for existence of the
feature. Future versions of this specification may include more exhaustive
tests.

Some tests may require additional hardware information to be provided,
such as base addresses or configuration data.  This information can be
provided by editing test source code files, or by supplying command
line arguments to the test, or by other suitable means.

The tests in this specification are documented use the following format:

|===
| TEST_ID#       ^| Test algorithm
| AB_CAT_NNN_MMM a| The `CAT_NNN` identifies a requirement in the RISC-V Server
                    SoC specification. Each requirement is associated with one
                    or more tests identified by `MMM`. The test IDs are prefixed
                    with two character prefix - `AB`.                          +
                                                                               +
                    If character in position `A` is `M` then the test is for a
                    requirement that MUST be supported and this test MUST pass.
                    If character in position `A` is `O` then the test is for a
                    requirement that SHOULD or MAY be supported; such tests may
                    be skipped if the requirement is not implemented. The tests
                    record if optional features were present in the test output
                    log.                                                       +
                                                                               +
                    The character in position `B` indicates the nature of the
                    test. If this character is `F` then the test exercises some
                    or all of the functionality associated with the feature. If
                    the character is `E` then the test determines for evidence
                    that the feature is implemented (e.g., check ACPI tables)
                    but does not functionally exercise the feature.

This specification groups the tests in the following broad categories:

* Harts
* Clocks and Timers
* External Interrupt Controllers
* IOMMU
* PCIe subsystem
* Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability
* Quality of Service
* Debug
* Trace
* Performance monitoring
* Security
