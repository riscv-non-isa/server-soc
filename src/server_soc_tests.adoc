== RISC-V PCIe Test Card

A PCIe test card is required to create stimulus for a subset of the tests. This
section outlines the design of such a test card. The PCIe test card shall be
designed to support a x1 PCIe lane and at least Gen 3 speeds. The test card
shall be implemented as a single device with two functions. Each function
implements the standard PCIe type 0 header and the following PCIe capabilities:

* PCIe Capability
* MSI Capability
* Power Management Capability
* ATS Capability
* DVSEC capability

Each function shall support a 64-bit memory BAR. The functions should support
all legal values of Max_Payload_Size.

The DVSEC capability of the function shall provide the following registers:

* `TEST_REG_1` - a 32-bit wide test register that can be written with a value
   between 0 and 8191. When the register is written with a value of `X`, the
   function will generate a completion for the CfgWr transaction that writes
   the register after a delay of `X` nanoseconds.

* `TEST_REG_2` - a 32-bit wide register that may be configured with a value
  that represents the duration in nanoseconds that the device should wait
  before starting to respond to transactions following a FLR.

The BAR 0 of the functions provide the following registers:

* `TEST_POISON_REG` - a 64-bit wide test register which always returns a EP=1
  completion on read.

* `SCRATCHPAD` - a 4 KiB read/write scratchpad register space that can be
  written using Mrd/Mwr transactions and supports all legal address and byte
  enable rules.

* `INJECTED_TLP` - a set of registers that can be used to setup the TLP header
  and if required the data payload of the TLP.

* `INJECT_TLP` - a control register to request the card to originate the TLP
  programmed in `INJECTED_TLP`.

* `LAST_RX_TLP` - a set of registers that hold the header and payload of the
  last TLP received by the function.
